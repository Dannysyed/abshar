          Education & Literacy
        </h3>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
          Recognizing the importance of education as a cornerstone for social
          and economic development, Abshar Trust has focused extensively on
          supporting the educational needs of underprivileged students in some
          areas of District Baramulla. Our educational initiatives are designed
          to ensure that every child has access to quality education and the
          resources necessary to thrive academically. Our initiatives include:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-2 text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Stationery Supplies:</strong> Abshar Trust has provided a
            wide range of stationery items, including notebooks, supporting
            books, pencils, pens, erasers, rulers, and drawing supplies. These
            basic yet crucial items help students perform daily academic tasks
            efficiently.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Shoes and Socks:</strong> We have distributed high-quality
            shoes and socks to ensure that students can attend school
            comfortably and confidently. Proper footwear is essential for
            students' overall health and well-being, and it also contributes to
            maintaining school dress codes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ties and Scarves:</strong> As part of our uniform
            distribution, we have provided ties and scarves to some students.
            These items, often considered minor, play a vital role in ensuring
            that students feel a sense of belonging and equality within their
            school environment.

          Food Security & Poverty Alleviation
        </h3>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg mb-6">
          Ensuring food security for the poor and vulnerable is one of the
          primary objectives of Abshar Trust. Our food distribution programs
          have made a significant impact on the lives of many families in

          <li>
            <strong>Food Drives:</strong> We organize special day (festivals)
            food drives to distribute essential food items such as rice, wheat,
            pulses, cooking oil, and other staples to impoverished families.
            These drives have provided much-needed relief to households
            struggling with food insecurity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Emergency Food Assistance:</strong> During times of crisis,
            such as natural disasters or economic downturns, Abshar Trust has
            swiftly mobilized resources to provide emergency food assistance,
            medicine, etc. This rapid response has been crucial in preventing
            hunger and malnutrition among the most vulnerable.
